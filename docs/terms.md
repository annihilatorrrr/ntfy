# Terms of Service

**Last updated:** January 26, 2026

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the ntfy.sh website and service (the "Service") 
operated by ntfy LLC ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These 
Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

**By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the 
Terms, you may not access the Service.**

## Service description

ntfy (pronounced "notify") is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. It allows you to send push 
notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer, using a REST API. The Service includes:

- The ntfy.sh hosted server
- The ntfy web application
- The ntfy mobile applications (Android and iOS)
- The ntfy command-line interface (CLI)

The server software and mobile applications are open source and can be [self-hosted](install.md). These Terms 
apply specifically to the ntfy.sh hosted service.

## Subscriptions and billing

### Free tier

You may use the Service without creating an account or subscribing to a paid plan. Free usage is subject to 
rate limits and other restrictions as described in our documentation.

### Paid plans

Some features of the Service are available only through paid subscription plans ("Subscriptions"). You will 
be billed in advance on a recurring basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are available on a monthly or 
annual basis.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless 
you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal through your account settings in the 
web application.

A valid payment method is required to process payment for your Subscription. You shall provide us with accurate 
and complete billing information. By submitting such payment information, you authorize us to charge all 
Subscription fees incurred through your account to your payment method.

Payment processing is handled by Stripe. Your payment information is subject to Stripe's 
[privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) and [terms of service](https://stripe.com/legal).

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we will retry the payment according to Stripe's retry 
schedule. If payment continues to fail after multiple attempts, your Subscription will be canceled and your 
account will revert to the free tier.

### Fee changes

We may, in our sole discretion and at any time, modify the Subscription fees for paid plans. Any fee change 
will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity 
to cancel your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after a fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the 
modified Subscription fee.

## Refunds

Refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion 
of ntfy LLC. To request a refund, please contact us at [billing@mail.ntfy.sh](mailto:billing@mail.ntfy.sh).

## User accounts

When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at 
all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of 
your account.

You are responsible for:

- Safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service
- Any activities or actions under your account, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service
- Keeping your account credentials confidential

You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware 
of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

You represent that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least the minimum age required to form
a binding contract in your jurisdiction, and have the legal authority to enter into these Terms.

## Acceptable use

You agree not to use the Service to:

- Send spam, unsolicited messages, or messages to recipients who have not consented to receive them
- Distribute malware, viruses, or any other malicious software
- Transmit illegal content or content that violates the rights of others
- Harass, abuse, or harm another person or group
- Impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other accounts, or computer systems
- Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations
- Circumvent rate limits or other technical restrictions
- Use the Service in a manner that could reasonably be expected to impose an unreasonable or disproportionately
  large load on our infrastructure

We reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate action against anyone who, in our sole discretion, 
violates this provision, including removing content, terminating accounts, and reporting to law enforcement.

### Topic names

Topic names on ntfy.sh are public. If you use the Service without access controls, your topic name functions 
as a password. You are responsible for choosing topic names that cannot be easily guessed. We are not responsible 
for any unauthorized access to messages published to easily guessable topic names.

For reserved topics and access control features, consider subscribing to a paid plan.

## Governing law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States,
without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state
courts located in Connecticut, and the parties hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. 
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions 
of these Terms will remain in effect.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede any prior agreements 
we might have had regarding the Service.

## Changes to these Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is 
material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.

What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. Changes will be posted on this 
page with an updated "Last updated" date. You may also review all changes in the 
[Git history](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/commits/main/docs/terms.md).
