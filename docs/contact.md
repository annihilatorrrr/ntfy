# Contact

This service is run by **Philipp C. Heckel**. There are several ways to get in touch with me and the 
ntfy community. Please choose the appropriate channel based on your needs.

## Community support (free)

For general questions, feature discussions, and community help, please use one of these public channels:

| Channel | Link | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Discord** | [discord.gg/cT7ECsZj9w](https://discord.gg/cT7ECsZj9w) | Real-time chat with the community (I'm `binwiederhier`) |
| **Matrix** | [#ntfy:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#ntfy:matrix.org) | Bridged from Discord, same community (I'm `binwiederhier`) |
| **Matrix Space** | [#ntfy-space:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#ntfy-space:matrix.org) | Matrix space with all ntfy rooms |
| **Lemmy** | [discuss.ntfy.sh/c/ntfy](https://discuss.ntfy.sh/c/ntfy) | Forum-style discussions |
| **GitHub Issues** | [github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues) | Bug reports and feature requests |

!!! info "Why public channels?"
    Answering questions in public channels benefits the entire community. Other users can learn from the 
    discussion, and answers can be referenced later. This is much more scalable than 1-on-1 support.

If you are subscribed to a [ntfy Pro](https://ntfy.sh/#pricing) plan, you are entitled to priority support 
via the following channels:
